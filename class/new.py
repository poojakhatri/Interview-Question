# There is a function called add_book() that takes a non-empty string containing the title of a book to add it to recommendations. 
# Share your favorite book with us by calling this function. You don't have to declare it, just call it in your code.

# Importantly, specify the keyword argument title in the call. Otherwise, you may get an error.


def add_book(title):
	recommendations=[]
	recommendations.append(title) 
	

title = "Rich Dad Poor Dad'"
add_book(title)
